## Current

- [ ] Codeforces reach 1600
- [ ] [Practice LLD](https://github.com/prasadgujar/low-level-design-primer/blob/master/solutions.md)

## Goal till 2025
In next 2-3 years I want to improve logic building and analysis, learn low level design, high level design, coding best practices and code reviews.

## Goal till 2027
In next 3-5 years I want to skill up myself to design and implement large scale customers facing applications using modern frameworks and practices.
