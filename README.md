## Current
- [ ] Leetcode 75 problems
- [ ] Codeforces reach 1600

## Goal for 2025
In next 2-3 years I want to improve logic building and analysis, learn low level design, high level design, coding best practices and code reviews.

In next 3-5 years I want to skill up myself to design and implement large scale applications for customers using modern frameworks and practices.
